01. Implement a hierarchy of classes, describing vegetables. A vegetable has color and some vegetables can be directly eaten, some can not. A tomato is a kind of vegetable which has a radius and can be eaten directly. A cucumber is a vegetable which has a length and cannot be eaten directly.
02. Implement a mushroom mixin. A mushroom mixin enables an object to grow by given an amount of water. Use the mixin to create a TomatoGmo and a CucumberGMO.
03. Group the classes in the previous exercises into namespaces â€“ there should be no classes in the global namespace
